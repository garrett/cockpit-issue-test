        Relevant parts of the server's log are useful.

        If the issue happened in the last 10 minutes, use: `journalctl --since -10m`
        If you know which systemd unit was affected, use: `journalctl -u cockpit -u <unit>`

        This will be automatically formatted, backticks are not needed.
