        Relevant parts of the server's log are useful.  This will be automatically formatted, backticks are not needed.

        - If the issue happened in the last 10 minutes, use: `journalctl --since -10m`
        - If you know which systemd unit was affected, use: `journalctl -u cockpit -u <unit>`

        Leave empty if unsure or if this doesn't apply.
